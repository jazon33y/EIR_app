# EIR_app
The beginnings of an R-shiny app that implements the equivalent indel (small DNA insertion or deletion) region (EIR) algorithm in R, plots the region and gives a summary of the indels that exist in the region within the 1000 genomes project variant database.

The app can compute and visualize the EIR of a particular indel with respects to the hg19 human reference sequence:

It also has the capability of querying popular databases for sequence variation that spans the same genomic regions as the indel that you input:
